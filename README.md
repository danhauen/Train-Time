#Temps de Train (AKA Train Time)

("https://danhauen.github.io/Train-Time/")

##Purpose

    - Demonstrate the use of Firebase and storing remote data
    - Demonstrate momentJS to calculate specific time results for the various results required
    - Appending to a table using Jquery with imputed results taken from Firebase
    - All information remains after refresh due to Firebase storage

##Function

   - This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data for   trains.

   - Athough this is created with trains in mind, with slight modifications, it can be useful in several      different applications due to its use of momentJS.

   - Users enter the required train information in the form. The data is then stored remotely in Firebase     and rendered on the train schedule portion of the page.
